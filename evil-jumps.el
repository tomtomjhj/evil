;;; Commentary:

;; A jumplist is a list of buffer positions. Your current position within a
;; file will be saved to the jumplist before executing certain motion commands
;; (more specifically, motion commands with a non-nil `:jump' property). For
;; example, pressing gg will save your current location to the jumplist and
;; move `point' to the beginning of the buffer. You can jump backward to the
;; saved position by pressing C-o (`evil-jump-backward'). On the first backward
;; jump, the position you jumped from will also be saved to the jumplist so
;; that you can return back to the location where you first pressed C-o, i.e.
;; jump forward through the jumplist, by pressing C-i (`evil-jump-forward').
;; You navigate the jumplist by additional presses of C-o and C-i.
;;
;; Your position on the jumplist will be maintained until a new jump point is
;; set, so that if you jump backward a few times and edit the buffer you may
;; jump forward to your original location as long as no new jump point was set
;; while modifying the buffer. To view the the current history of jumps, run
;; the Ex command :ju[mps] or bind `evil-show-jumps' to an appropriate key.
;;
;; In addition to setting a jump point before executing some motion commands,
;; jump points are set before every buffer switch and before every window
;; split. To prevent setting a jump point for commands that switch buffers or
;; split windows you may add the command to `evil-jumps-ignored-commands'. As
;; an example, since `evil-show-jumps' splits the window a new jump point would
;; be added every time you view the jumplist if it were not in
;; `evil-jumps-ignored-commands'. There is also
;; `evil-jumps-ignored-file-patterns' which prevents setting jump points
;; in files matching any of the patterns, and
;; `evil-jumps-allowed-buffer-patterns' which allows setting jump points in
;; buffers with names that match any of the patterns when the buffer is not
;; associated with a file.
;;
;; The jumplist only contains unique jump points. Jumps that exist on the same
;; line of a file are considered the same and only the most recently set jump
;; point on the line will be present in the jumplist.

;; Implementation details
;;
;; Jumplists are stored in frame/window parameters as the `evil-jumplist'
;; parameter. The frame's jumplist acts as the default jumplist. When a window
;; is deleted, its jumplist is merged into the frame's jumplist. When a new
;; window is split from an existing window the new window's jumplist is
;; obtained first by trying to copy over the existing window's jumplist and if
;; that fails, by copying the jumplist of the frame. To avoid unnecessary
;; copying, only shallow copies of a jumplist are made when copying over
;; jumplists to new windows. Fully independent copies are made only when the
;; jumplist of a window is first modified. This behavior differs from Vim which
;; creates an independent copy whenever the new window is created. In Emacs,
;; windows pop in and out of existence very frequently and there are many cases
;; in which a jump point will never be set in a window so this design decision
;; seems justified. As an example, there does not seem to be a point in copying
;; a jumplist to the *Completions* window whenever it pops up.
;;
;; The object stored in the `evil-jumplist' parameter is a cons cell,
;; (COPY-FLAG . RING), where COPY-FLAG is t if RING must be copied before
;; setting a new jump point in the window or attempting to modify RING in any
;; way. RING stores the jumplist in the form of a ring data structure.
;;
;; Navigating through jumps in RING is implemented through ring rotations, i.e.
;; deletion of the oldest (newest) element of RING and subsequent insertion as
;; the newest (oldest) element. Rotating RING forward (oldest -> newest) jumps
;; to newly set jump points and rotating RING backward (newest -> oldest) jumps
;; to older ones.
;;
;; Instead of keeping track of an index which determines the most recently
;; visited jump point, a sentinel value is placed in RING, as the first element
;; before any jumps are added, and acts to orient the jumps in RING. All jumps
;; with indices less than the index of the sentinel are backward jumps, indices
;; larger than the sentinel are forward jumps. The sentinel value is simply the
;; symbol, `evil'.
;;
;; The sentinel also determines the two states that RING can be in: if a
;; backward jump has been made between calls to `evil-set-jump' or not. If no
;; backward jumps have been made, the oldest element in RING is the sentinel
;; value. Otherwise the oldest element is the most recent backward jump.
;;
;; So for example if RING is
;;
;;     (A B C ... evil)
;;
;; then no backward jumps have been made and A is the most recently set jump.
;; Then after a backward jump to A, RING would look like
;;
;;     (B C ... evil A)
;;
;; After one more backward jump, RING would look like
;;
;;     (C ... evil A B)
;;
;; with `point' at the location specified by B. Making a forward jump to A,
;; RING would become
;;
;;     (B C ... evil A)
;;
;; Since A is the most recently set jump, there are no more forward jumps that
;; can be made and additional attempts to jump forward will leave RING in the
;; same state. Notice that after each forward/backward jump, `point' is left at
;; the location specified by the oldest element of RING. It looks like we have
;; found something pretty close to being an invariant in this representation of
;; a jumplist. After every jumplist operation, the oldest element of RING will
;; be the most recently jumped to location.
;;
;; When a new jump point is set, regardles of which jump point is the most
;; recently visited, RING is reset to the state where the sentinel is the
;; oldest element, so if we set a new jump point at D, RING would be
;;
;;    (D A B C ... evil)
